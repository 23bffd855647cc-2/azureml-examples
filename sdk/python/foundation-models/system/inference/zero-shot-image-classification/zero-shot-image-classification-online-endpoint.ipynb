    "## Zero-Shot Image Classification Inference using Online Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to deploy `zero-shot-image-classification` type models to an online endpoint for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "`zero-shot-image-classification` takes in images and a set of user provided labels. For each image, probabilities are assigned corresponding to the potential labels.\n",
    "Zero-Shot image classification uses a pre-trained model to run inference on data with classes that were not used during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "Models that can perform the `zero-shot-image-classification` task are tagged with `zero-shot-image-classification`. We will use the `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` model in this notebook. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. If you don't find a model that suits your scenario or domain, you can discover and [import models from HuggingFace hub](../../import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb) and then use them for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference data\n",
    "We will use the [fridgeObjects](https://cvbp-secondary.z19.web.core.windows.net/datasets/image_classification/fridgeObjects.zip) dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "1. Setup pre-requisites\n",
    "2. Pick a model to deploy\n",
    "3. Prepare data for inference\n",
    "4. Deploy the model to an online endpoint for real time inference\n",
    "5. Test the endpoint\n",
    "6. Clean up resources - delete the online endpoint"
